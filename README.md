#####  This weather app allows you to enter a city name and get the current weather for that city. The app makes a request to a weather API, which returns data about the current weather in the city. The app then displays the temperature, humidity, and a description of the weather. To use the app, you can enter a city name into the input field and click the "Get Weather" button. The weather data for the specified city will then be displayed on the page.
